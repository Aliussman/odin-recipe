  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
        Pepperoni pizza is a classic favorite known for its bold, savory flavor and irresistible aroma. 
        It starts with a crispy or chewy crust layered with rich tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese, then topped generously with slices of pepperoni. 
        As the pizza bakes, the pepperoni curls slightly and releases its signature spicy, smoky oils, blending perfectly with the creamy cheese and tangy sauce.

        Loved around the world, pepperoni pizza strikes the perfect balance between comfort and indulgence. Whether enjoyed fresh from the oven at a family gathering or as a quick meal with friends, its simple ingredients and robust taste make it a timeless choice for pizza lovers of all ages.

    </li>
    <li>Add the sauce:
        <ul>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add cheese:
        <ul>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add pepperoni:

    </li>
    <li>Bake the pizza:
