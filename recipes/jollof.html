  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
      Jollof rice is a vibrant, flavorful West African one-pot dish featuring long-grain rice cooked in a rich tomato, chili, and onion sauce, seasoned with spices like garlic, thyme, and ginger, resulting in a signature reddish hue and deeply savory taste, often served at celebrations with meat, fish, or vegetables. It's a cultural emblem, with variations across countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal, sparking friendly "Jollof Wars" over who makes the best version. 
        Key Characteristics:
        Base: A blended puree of tomatoes, red bell peppers, onions, and hot peppers (like Scotch Bonnet), creating a sweet and spicy foundation.
        Rice: Long-grain rice, often parboiled, absorbs the sauce for maximum flavor.
        Color: Deep red or orange, from the tomato base and sometimes paprika.
        Spices: Aromatic blend including garlic, ginger, thyme, and bay leaves, adding earthy and warm notes.
        One-Pot Meal: All ingredients are cooked together, allowing flavors to meld beautifully.
        Cultural Significance: A staple for gatherings, symbolizing identity and pride, with unique regional twists.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the dough:
        <ul> In a bowl, mix flour, yeast, salt, warm water, and a little olive oil. Knead the mixture until it forms a smooth dough. Cover and let it rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven:
        <ul>Preheat your oven to 220–250°C (425–480°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it heats.</ul>

    <li>Shape the dough:
        <ul>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a round pizza base. Transfer it to a baking tray or pizza pan.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add the sauce:
        <ul>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add cheese:
        <ul>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add pepperoni:
        <ul>Arrange pepperoni slices evenly on top of the cheese.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Bake the pizza:
        <ul>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Serve:
        <ul>Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, slice, and enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!</ul>
    </li>
